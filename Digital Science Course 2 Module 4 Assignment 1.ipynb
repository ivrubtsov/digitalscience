It allows to release all the computing power and help people in solving problems those aren't possible for a human. For example, it can process huge amount of data, make extremely fast decisions and adjust its methology over time. For example, credit analysis and scoring can take months if it is performed by a human and take seconds with a computer model.*"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### My code calculates the total amount of pull-ups if they are performed in a ladder-style.
